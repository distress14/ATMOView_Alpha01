Needs to be checked:

1. QLineEdit *line 1 = new QLineEdit(&UserInputWindow)

2. QLabel *label1 = new QLabel("Opzione 1: ", &UserInputWindow)

3. QCheckBox *checkBox = new QCheckBox("Select Value (0-4)", &UserInputWindow);
4. QPushButton *okButton = new QPushButton("OK", &UserInputWindow);

5. QObject::connect(okButton, &QPushButton::clicked, &UserInputWindow, &QDialog::accept);


6. UserInputWindow.exec() == QDialog::Accepted

7. // Ottenere i valori degli input

        QString input1 = lineEdit1->text();
        QString input2 = lineEdit2->text();
        int checkedValue = checkBox->isChecked() ? 1 : 0;


8. Virtual Function

A virtual function is a function in a base class that is declared using the keyword virtual.
Defining in a base class a virtual function, with another version in a derived class, signals
to the compiler that we don't want static linkage for this function.

What we do want is the selection of the function to be called at any
given point in the program to be based on the kind of object for which it is called.
This sort of operation is referred to as dynamic linkage, or late binding.
